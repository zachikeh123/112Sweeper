My Term Project is going to be 112Sweeper, with inspiration from the popular game Minesweeper Online.
The game consists of a clickable tile grid with hidden "mines" spread all over the board. 
The number of mines next to a cell is indicated by its number. 
You can identify cells that are mine-free and those that are safe using this information. 
The space bar can be used to “flag” cells that appear to be mines. 
I implemented some helpful power-ups that can only be used once and after you reach a certain goal, activated only when the user clicks on the icon once it's in color.
The game is over when all the mines have been flagged or when you click a mine.
In order to run the project, the Main.py method should be run in an editor. 
I did not install any libraries or fonts, and there aren't any shortcuts or shortcut commands.
It should all be straightforward.
